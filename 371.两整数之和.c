/*
I have been confused about bit manipulation for a very long time. So I decide to do a summary about it here.

"&" AND operation, for example, 2 (0010) & 7 (0111) => 2 (0010)

"^" XOR operation, for example, 2 (0010) ^ 7 (0111) => 5 (0101)

"~" NOT operation, for example, ~2(0010) => -3 (1101) what??? Don't get frustrated here. It's called two's complement.

1111 is -1, in two's complement

1110 is -2, which is ~2 + 1, ~0010 => 1101, 1101 + 1 = 1110 => 2

1101 is -3, which is ~3 + 1

so if you want to get a negative number, you can simply do ~x + 1
